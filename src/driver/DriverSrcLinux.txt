Instructions for Linux driver                     2011-06-19 Agner Fog

To install the Linux driver for PMCTest under Linux, 32 or 64 bit, 
unzip DriverSrcLinux.zip, make and install the driver according to 
the following commands. Must reinstall after reboot.
The driver has only been tested in Ubuntu.


make install


In some older systems you may need to replace MSRdrv.c with MSRdrv1.c if
compilation gives errors.

If build directory is missing:

sudo ln -s /usr/src/linux-headers-`uname -r` /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build

Or if the target doesn't exist, e.g.:

sudo ln -s /usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.24-23-server /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build
